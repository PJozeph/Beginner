/* Statement: A programming statement performs a piece of programming action. 
 * It must be terminated by a semi-colon (;),
 * (just like an English sentence is ended with a period) as in Lines 6.
 */

/* Block: A block is a group of programming statements enclosed by braces { }. 
 * This group of statements is treated as one single unit. 
 * There are two blocks in this program. One contains the body of the class Hello. 
 * The other contains the body of the main() method. 
 * There is no need to put a semi-colon after the closing brace.
 */

/* Comments: A multi-line comment begins with (/*) and ends with (star/). 
* An end-of-line comment begins with (//) and lasts till the end of the line. 
* Comments are NOT executable statements and are ignored by the compiler. 
* But they provide useful explanation and documentation. Use comments liberally.
*/

/* Whitespaces: Blank, tab, and newline are collectively called whitespace. 
 * Extra whitespaces are ignored, i.e., only one whitespace is needed to separate the tokens. 
 * But they could help you and your readers better understand your program. 
 * Use extra whitespaces liberally.
 */

/* Case Sensitivity: 
 * Java is case sensitive - a ROSE is NOT a Rose, and is NOT a rose. 
 * The filename is also case-sensitive.
